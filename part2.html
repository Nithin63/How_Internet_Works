            <h1 class="mt-3">IP ADDRESS</h1>
            IP (Internet Protocol) Address is an address of your network hardware. It helps in connecting your computer
            to other devices on your network and all over the world. An IP Address is made up of numbers or characters.

            An example of an IP address would be: 506.457.14.512

            All devices that are connected to an internet connection have a unique IP address which means there’s a need
            of billions of IP addresses. This requirement is fulfilled by the new IP version IPv6.

            There are are two IP versions: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the older version which has an space of over 4 billion
            IP addresses. However, the new IPv6 version can provide up to trillions of IP addresses to fulfill the need
            of all internet users and devices.

            The IPv4 version used to configure IP addresses in numerical value (numbers) which may conflict with other
            IP addresses. That’s why IPv6 adopted the hexadecimal method to provide unique IP addresses to billions of
            users in the world.

            Example of an IPv6 IP address would be:

            4ggr:1925:5656:7:600:t4tt:tc54:98vt

            There are a few types of IP addresses like private IP addresses, public IP addresses, static IP addresses
            and dynamic IP addresses. Let’s talk about these different types of IP addresses one by one:

            Private IP Address

            A private IP address is the address of your device connected on the home or business network. If you have a
            few different devices connected to one ISP (Internet Service Provider), then all your devices will have a
            unique private IP address. This IP address cannot be accessed from devices outside your home or business
            network.

            For example: 192.168.1.1

            Private IP addresses are not unique because there are limited number of devices on your network.

            You can find out the private IP address of your device using a few techniques. If you are a Windows user,
            then simply go to the command prompt and enter the command ipconfig. If you’re a mac users, then you need to
            enter the following command ifconfig in your Terminal app

            If you are using the internet on a mobile phone, then you can go to your WiFi settings to find out the IP
            address. iOS users can find the IP address by clicking on the ‘i‘ button next to the network they are
            connected to. Android users can click on the network name in their WiFi settings, and it will show the IP
            address.

            Public IP Address

            Your public IP address is the main IP address to which your home or business network is connected. This IP
            address connects you to the world, and it’s unique for all users.

            To find out your public IP address, simply go to SupportAlly site in your browser, and it will display the
            public IP, and other browser information.

            Static and Dynamic IP Addresses

            All private and public IP addresses can be either static or dynamic. IP addresses that you configure
            manually and fix them to the network of your device are called static IP addresses. Static IP addresses
            cannot change automatically.

            The dynamic IP address configures automatically and assign an IP to your network when you set up the router
            with internet. This distribution of IP addresses is managed by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).
            DHCP can be your internet router that assigns an IP address to your network in your home or business
            environment.
