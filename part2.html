            <p style="text-align:left">
                IP (Internet Protocol)Address is an address of your network hardware. It helps in connecting your
                computer
                to other devices on your network and all over the world. An IP Address is made up of numbers or
                characters.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left" >
                An example of an IP address would be: 506.457.14.512
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                All devices that are connected to an internet connection have a unique IP address which means there’s a
                need
                of billions of IP addresses. This requirement is fulfilled by the new IP version IPv6.
            </p >
            <p style="text-align:left">
                There are are two IP versions: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the older version which has an space of over 4
                billion
                IP addresses. However, the new IPv6 version can provide up to trillions of IP addresses to fulfill the
                need
                of all internet users and devices.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                The IPv4 version used to configure IP addresses in numerical value (numbers) which may conflict with
                other
                IP addresses. That’s why IPv6 adopted the hexadecimal method to provide unique IP addresses to billions
                of
                users in the world.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                Example of an IPv6 IP address would be:
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                4ggr:1925:5656:7:600:t4tt:tc54:98vt
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                There are a few types of IP addresses like private IP addresses, public IP addresses, static IP
                addresses
                and dynamic IP addresses. Let’s talk about these different types of IP addresses one by one:
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                Private IP Address
            </p >
            <p style="text-align:left">
                A private IP address is the address of your device connected on the home or business network. If you
                have a
                few different devices connected to one ISP (Internet Service Provider), then all your devices will have
                a
                unique private IP address. This IP address cannot be accessed from devices outside your home or business
                network.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                For example: 192.168.1.1
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                Private IP addresses are not unique because there are limited number of devices on your network.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                You can find out the private IP address of your device using a few techniques. If you are a Windows
                user,
                then simply go to the command prompt and enter the command ipconfig. If you’re a mac users, then you
                need to
                enter the following command ifconfig in your Terminal app
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                If you are using the internet on a mobile phone, then you can go to your WiFi settings to find out the
                IP
                address. iOS users can find the IP address by clicking on the ‘i‘ button next to the network they are
                connected to. Android users can click on the network name in their WiFi settings, and it will show the
                IP
                address.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                Public IP Address
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                Your public IP address is the main IP address to which your home or business network is connected. This
                IP
                address connects you to the world, and it’s unique for all users.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left"
                To find out your public IP address, simply go to SupportAlly site in your browser, and it will display
                the
                public IP, and other browser information.>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                Static and Dynamic IP Addresses
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left"
                All private and public IP addresses can be either static or dynamic. IP addresses that you configure
                manually and fix them to the network of your device are called static IP addresses. Static IP addresses
                cannot change automatically.>

        <br>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                The dynamic IP address configures automatically and assign an IP to your network when you set up the
                router
                with internet. This distribution of IP addresses is managed by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
                (DHCP).
                DHCP can be your internet router that assigns an IP address to your network in your home or business
                environment.

                Packets use Type of Service to request special treatment (e.g. being put at the front of any queues).
                The identification, flags, and fragmentation offset fields keep track of each fragment when an IP packet
                is
                split up into smaller packets.
                The time to live is set when the IP packet is sent off, and the number is reduced by 1 each time the
                packet
                goes through a router. When the time to live gets to 0, the packet is deleted. This stops packets from
                circulating in a loop.
                You can find all the details about the header of IPv4 packets as well as the header of IPv6 packets on
                Wikipedia.

                <img src="img/downld.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br>


            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left"> Routers got their name because they route IP Packets across networks: a router device connects different
                links. It examines IP packet headers, looking at the destination address and consulting a routing table
                of
                known networks. The table indicates which connections to send the packet on as the next link. The
                connections on a router are called interfaces: through the router, they interface between different link
                types.

            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left"> An IP packet enters a circle labelled as a router. An arrow links its destination address to a routing
                table, with two columns, "NET" and "INT". The IP packet is shown leaving the router along a path to
                device
                A, a tablet. The router is also connected to devices B, C and D, a printer, a desktop, and a laptop
                respectively.

            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left"> In the animation, an IP packet arrives at a router, which compares the packet’s destination address with
                the
                networks in the routing table. The packet is identified as belonging to network A, so the router routes
                it
                out of interface 1.

            </p>
            <p style="text-align:left"> Often, routers learn how to reach distant networks by exchanging information with their neighbouring
                routers
                and building their own routing tables. This exchange of information to learn about other networks is
                called
                a routing protocol. You can find more information about routing protocols on Wikipedia.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align:left">
                Several different devices with different IP addresses in the 192.168.1.X network are connected to a
                switch,
                by wired or wireless connections. The switch is inside a circle labelled "Home hub/gateway/router",
                which
                also contains a smaller circle labelled "Router" and a box labelled "Modem" . A line labelled LAN with
                the
                IP network address 192.168.1.0 connects the switch and router, and a line labelled WAN with the IP
                address
                82.5.6.11 connects the router and the modem. The modem is connected to an ISP (outside the home hub
                circle),
                and the ISP is connected to the internet. </p>
