            DNS Basics
            All computers on the Internet, from your smart phone or laptop to the servers that serve content for massive
            retail websites, find and communicate with one another by using numbers. These numbers are known as IP
            addresses. When you open a web browser and go to a website, you don't have to remember and enter a long
            number. Instead, you can enter a domain name like example.com and still end up in the right place.

            A DNS service such as Amazon Route 53 is a globally distributed service that translates human readable names
            like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each
            other. The Internetâ€™s DNS system works much like a phone book by managing the mapping between names and
            numbers. DNS servers translate requests for names into IP addresses, controlling which server an end user
            will reach when they type a domain name into their web browser. These requests are called queries.


            Types of DNS Service
            Authoritative DNS: An authoritative DNS service provides an update mechanism that developers use to manage
            their public DNS names. It then answers DNS queries, translating domain names into IP address so computers
            can communicate with each other. Authoritative DNS has the final authority over a domain and is responsible
            for providing answers to recursive DNS servers with the IP address information. Amazon Route 53 is an
            authoritative DNS system.

            Recursive DNS: Clients typically do not make queries directly to authoritative DNS services. Instead, they
            generally connect to another type of DNS service known a resolver, or a recursive DNS service. A recursive
            DNS service acts like a hotel concierge: while it doesn't own any DNS records, it acts as an intermediary
            who can get the DNS information on your behalf. If a recursive DNS has the DNS reference cached, or stored
            for a period of time, then it answers the DNS query by providing the source or IP information. If not, it
            passes the query to one or more authoritative DNS servers to find the information.

            How Does DNS Route Traffic To Your Web Application?
            The following diagram gives an overview of how recursive and authoritative DNS services work together to
            route an end user to your website or application.
            how-route-53-routes-traffic
            A user opens a web browser, enters www.example.com in the address bar, and presses Enter.
            The request for www.example.com is routed to a DNS resolver, which is typically managed by the user's
            Internet service provider (ISP), such as a cable Internet provider, a DSL broadband provider, or a corporate
            network.
            The DNS resolver for the ISP forwards the request for www.example.com to a DNS root name server.
            The DNS resolver for the ISP forwards the request for www.example.com again, this time to one of the TLD
            name servers for .com domains. The name server for .com domains responds to the request with the names of
            the four Amazon Route 53 name servers that are associated with the example.com domain.
            The DNS resolver for the ISP chooses an Amazon Route 53 name server and forwards the request for
            www.example.com to that name server.
            The Amazon Route 53 name server looks in the example.com hosted zone for the www.example.com record, gets
            the associated value, such as the IP address for a web server, 192.0.2.44, and returns the IP address to the
            DNS resolver.
            The DNS resolver for the ISP finally has the IP address that the user needs. The resolver returns that value
            to the web browser. The DNS resolver also caches (stores) the IP address for example.com for an amount of
            time that you specify so that it can respond more quickly the next time someone browses to example.com. For
            more information, see time to live (TTL).
            The web browser sends a request for www.example.com to the IP address that it got from the DNS resolver.
            This is where your content is, for example, a web server running on an Amazon EC2 instance or an Amazon S3
            bucket that's configured as a website endpoint.
            The web server or other resource at 192.0.2.44 returns the web page for www.example.com to the web browser,
            and the web browser displays the page.
