            <h1 class="mt-3">DOMAIN NAMES</h1>
            <p> What is a domain name?
                A domain name is your website name. A domain name is the address where Internet users can access your
                website. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP
                addresses, which are a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of
                numbers.
                Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than
                using
                IP addresses.</p>

            <p>A domain name can be any combination of letters and numbers, and it can be used in combination of the
                various domain name extensions, such as .com, .net and more.</p>

            <p>The domain name must be registered before you can use it. Every domain name is unique. No two websites
                can
                have the same domain name. If someone types in www.yourdomain.com, it will go to your website and no one
                else's.</p>

            <p>The price of a domain name typically runs between $15-25 per year.</p>

            <p>A domain name is an essential part of having a website, but it's only part of the equation. In order to
                launch a website, you'll also need content and a hosting service to store your files so they can be
                accessed
                on the internet. Remember that owning a domain does not mean hosting is also included.</p>

            <p>With Website.com, a professional domain name is included for free with all premium site builder plans.
                The
                website builder will allow you to create your website, and includes hosting services so you can publish
                your
                website to live when you're ready. With our current promo, you can own a custom domain name and create
                your
                entire website at only $2/month for the first year.</p>

            <p>Professional emails at your domain name can also help you boost your credibility and build your brand.
                For
                example, info@yourdomain.com can make your website seem more trustworthy and legitimate. Email accounts
                are
                included with Website.com Elite plans and above, starting at the promo price of just $5/month for the
                first
                year.</p>
            <h1 class="mt-3">ICANN</h1>
            <p>
                What Is ICANN and Why Does It Matter?</p>
            <p>
            ICANN is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. It is a nonprofit organization
            headquartered in Southern California that was formed in 1998 to help the U.S. government manage certain
            functions that maintain the Internet’s core infrastructure. ICANN maintains the central repository for IP
            addresses and helps coordinate the supply of IP addresses. It also manages the domain name system and root
            servers. ICANN currently manages over 180 million domain names and four billion network addresses across 240
            countries. It is also important to note that which ICANN does not control, such as content on the Internet,
            malware or spam and Internet access.</p>

            <p>
            In order to better understand ICANN, its responsibilities and its future, there a few other acronyms to
            become familiar with:</p>

            <p>
            DNS – Domain Name System, a global naming system that translates numerical IP addresses to domain names<?
            <p>
            IANA – Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, a part of ICANN that performs technical services critical to
            maintaining the DNS</p>
            <p>
            NTIA – National Telecommunications and Information Administration, an organization that is part of the U.S.
            Department of Commerce and currently in charge of overseeing ICANN</p>
            <p>
            TLD – Top-Level Domain, includes .com, .org, country codes such as .uk and mx and other suffixes.</p>
            <p>
            Upcoming Changes to DNS Control
            For several years, the plan has been to transition oversight of the DNS from the NTIA to international
            multi-stakeholder oversight through ICANN. This process began in 2014 when the NTIA asked ICANN to outline
            the transition in a detailed proposal. Today, the NTIA continues to play a role in verifying and authorizing
            ICANN’s functions, but the transition to complete ICANN control is scheduled to take place on September 30,
            2016. </p>

            <p>
            Why It Matters
            It is a widely-held belief that the Internet should not fall under the control of one stakeholder, whether
            that be a business, individual or government. While the NTIA has confirmed that ICANN has measures in place
            that will ensure multi-stakeholder control and maintain Internet openness, there are still many concerns as
            to how ICANN will function as an independent body.</p>
            <p>
            ICANN currently gets its authority to manage the DNS via the IANA contract, granted to them by the U.S.
            government, but that would change under the proposed plan. Authority would pass directly to ICANN without
            U.S. government oversight. While concerns are that other countries will have more of an influence on the
            Internet, the plan is designed with the intentions of avoiding increasing any government’s power over the
            Internet. While it is not ICANN’s job to regulate content online, there are concerns that this could come
            about through shared international control of the DNS. However, there is a real effort being made to ensure
            that ICANN cannot regulate content following the transition. There are also concerns over how well ICANN
            will be able to come to decisions on controversial matters. It is vital that these processes are set up
            correctly from the beginning, because domain-level takedowns could lead to violations of freedom of speech
            and freedom of press.</p>
            <p>
            Get Involved
            The U.S. Congress can still have an effect on the transition by controlling the NTIA’s actions. One of three
            things can occur on or before September 30: the control of IANA functions can be fully transitioned to
            ICANN, the transition can be delayed and NTIA’s contract with ICANN can be extended for up to three years,
            or Congress will not allow the NTIA to relinquish its authority over IANA functions. Contact your
            Congressman with any concerns you might have.</p>
