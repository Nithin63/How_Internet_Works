            <h1 class="mt-3">DOMAIN NAMES</h1>
            <p> What is a domain name?
            A domain name is your website name. A domain name is the address where Internet users can access your
            website. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP
            addresses, which are a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers.
            Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using
                IP addresses.</p>

            <p>A domain name can be any combination of letters and numbers, and it can be used in combination of the
                various domain name extensions, such as .com, .net and more.</p>

            <p>The domain name must be registered before you can use it. Every domain name is unique. No two websites can
            have the same domain name. If someone types in www.yourdomain.com, it will go to your website and no one
                else's.</p>

            <p>The price of a domain name typically runs between $15-25 per year.</p>

            <p>A domain name is an essential part of having a website, but it's only part of the equation. In order to
            launch a website, you'll also need content and a hosting service to store your files so they can be accessed
                on the internet. Remember that owning a domain does not mean hosting is also included.</p>

            <p>With Website.com, a professional domain name is included for free with all premium site builder plans. The
            website builder will allow you to create your website, and includes hosting services so you can publish your
            website to live when you're ready. With our current promo, you can own a custom domain name and create your
                entire website at only $2/month for the first year.</p>

            <p>Professional emails at your domain name can also help you boost your credibility and build your brand. For
            example, info@yourdomain.com can make your website seem more trustworthy and legitimate. Email accounts are
            included with Website.com Elite plans and above, starting at the promo price of just $5/month for the first
                year.</p>
