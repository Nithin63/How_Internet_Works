            <p style="text-align:right">
                W3C standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented
                potential
                to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores, that are
                available
                on any device. Although the boundaries of the platform continue to evolve, industry leaders speak nearly
                in
                unison about how HTML5 will be the cornerstone for this platform. But the full strength of the platform
                relies on many more technologies that W3C and its partners are creating, including CSS, SVG, WOFF, the
                Semantic Web stack, XML, and a variety of APIs.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                W3C develops these technical specifications and guidelines through a process designed to maximize
                consensus
                about the content of a technical report, to ensure high technical and editorial quality, and to earn
                endorsement by W3C and the broader community.</p>

            <p style="text-align:left">
            <h1 class="mt-3">HTML</h1></p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                <img src="img/What-is-HTML.jpg.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br>
                HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. "Markup language" means that, rather than using a programming
                language to perform functions, HTML uses tags to identify different types of content and the purposes
                they
                each serve to the webpage.</p>


            <p style="text-align:left">
                Markup languages work in the same way as you just did when you labeled those content types, except they
                use
                code to do it -- specifically, they use HTML tags, also known as "elements." These tags have pretty
                intuitive names: Header tags, paragraph tags, image tags, and so on.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                Every web page is made up of a bunch of these HTML tags denoting each type of content on the page. Each
                type
                of content on the page is "wrapped" in, i.e. surrounded by, HTML tags.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                For example, the words you're reading right now are part of a paragraph. If I were coding this web page
                from
                scratch (instead of using the WYSIWG editor in HubSpot's CMS), I would have started this paragraph with
                an
                opening paragraph tag:
            <p style="text-align:left">. The "tag" part is denoted by open brackets, and the letter "p" tells the
                computer that we're opening a paragraph instead of some other type of content.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                Once a tag has been opened, all of the content that follows is assumed to be part of that tag until you
                "close" the tag. When the paragraph ends, I'd put a closing paragraph tag: </p>.

            <p style="text-align:left">
                Using HTML, you can add headings, format paragraphs, control line breaks, make lists, emphasize text,
                create
                special characters, insert images, create links, build tables, control some styling, and much more.</p>

            <p style="text-align:left">

            <img src="img/What-is-HTML.jpg.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br>
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This programming language dictates how the HTML elements of a
                website
                should actually appear on the frontend of the page.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                HTML vs CSS
                HTML provides the raw tools needed to structure content on a website. CSS, on the other hand, helps to
                style
                this content so it appears to the user the way it was intended to be seen. These languages are kept
                separate
                to ensure websites are built correctly before they're reformatted.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                If HTML is the drywall, CSS is the paint.</p>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                Whereas HTML was the basic structure of your website, CSS is what gives your entire website its style.
                Those
                slick colors, interesting fonts, and background images? All thanks to CSS. This language affects the
                entire
                mood and tone of a web page, making it an incredibly powerful tool -- and an important skill for web
                developers to learn. It's also what allows websites to adapt to different screen sizes and device types.
